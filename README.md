To run the gesture contol:

1. Ensure both `HandTracking.py` and `FriendsGestureVolumeControl.py` are in the same workspace directory.
2. Install OpenCV by running: 'pip install opencv-python'

The `HandTracking.py` script defines a `handDetector` class that leverages the OpenCV library to detect and track hand gestures in real time.
